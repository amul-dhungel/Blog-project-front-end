			<p>Human mind has achieved everything by the power of imagination. It is by the virtue of imagination that man was ushered in an age dominated by revolutionary technological developments. From the day of landing on the moon to that of a trip to Mars; from the introduction of Microsoft Windows to the inception of 3G and 4G technologies; from revolutionary internet search engines to addictive social networking websites. Technological developments have impacted our lives in such a way, that it is next to impossible to imagine this world without it's presence. Obviously, development in technology has led to a far better, comfortable and easier life for people. However, on the flip side, it has equally created numerous problems. Mostly this problem has stemmed from the misuse of technology.</p><br>

				<p>The positive aspects of technology is immensely high in number to count. It's almost close to impossible to imagine a world without tech these days. From the field of education to that of business and even agriculture, there is a very vast use of technology. Global trading and business has become so much easier,faster and reliable. Running a bank without using a computer is nearly unexpectable. The bills and the account related work, the shopping malls and the bus stations, every single place is heavenly affected by technologies. For example, the ATM technology has made it so easy for people to withdraw money anywhere at any time. Not only has it made it easier but also safer. Noone has to carry even a single coin just because of the ATMs.The education sector will not be able to thrive without the use of technology. Our forefathers never got the chance to study in a class full with projectors and internet's. This is a clear example of showing how technologies changed our lives from the past few decades.Besides using notebooks and pencils, students use laptops and PowerPoints to study these days. Education has been computer-dominated this era and has reached a different dimension. We don't have to go to school or colleges due to online education and distance learning. Similarly, technology has revoluntarized the way we communicate. Websites like Facebook and Instagram has helped us to connect with the world. It has been able to maintain not only business relationships but also personal ones too. Latest gadets like iPhones and MacBooks have become a part of our daily life. No matter how far we are,we are able to connect with everyone through telecommunication service at any time of the day.</p><br>
				
				<p>There is a flaw to everything. In seeking the points of technology demerits, there are lots of negative aspects of technology. Internet scams are increasing everyday despite the cyber security and cyber laws. People are addicted to using social medias and are always glued to those websites. Lifestyle has changed drastically. Addiction is not good to health whether it's a good addition or a bad one. Children's of age 3 deny to eat there meals without watching a popular website called YouTube. The impact of misuse of technology can be devastating to us if we don't keep ourselves in check. Social isolation is a big issue globally as children have no time for social functions and family gatherings. People isolate everyone and get busy in their phones and iPods and just keep staring at their screen. This is going to result in obesity. Lack of excercise and being inactive is a result to this. Lack of contact with people and no physical exercise is going to lead us to depression. Of course there are antidepressants to overcome depression like nothing ever happened but why not cure it without the use of chemicals? People do nothing but just scroll their feeds and watch YouTube videos and it's already 1 am in the morning. People forget to even sleep which is very bad to our health. Studies have shown that the ambient glow on the screen decreses the secretion of melatonin hormones which is known as the sleeping chemical.</p><br> 
				
				<p>In the conclusion, technology is both a boon and a curse to us. It all depends on the person who's using it. I am a programming student myself just because I was so much influenced by all these technologies and I wanted to learn more about it. This doesn't mean I will be dedicating my whole time to it. We must know the right time and order to be involved in it. Thomas Alva Edison did a great job inventing light and giving birth to all these technological ideas. But we must make sure that it always remains as a good support to our daily life rather than making it the only cause of our unwellness. There's no doubt in how technologies changed our life from a zero to 100. But if used without awareness it will lead us to negative 1 too. We should never forget about the flip side of technology. We can make a difference in our life if we use it wisely. We must learn to get benefits from it rather than getting addicted to it.</p><br>
